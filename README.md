# ShineProject-API

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d0d321061db24a1caf2c8d2a59e94b4a)](https://app.codacy.com/app/spam_2/ShineProject-API?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=tommcclean/ShineProject-API&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

ShineProject is an application which allows end users to create to-do lists to stay organised. This is a personal project which i have decided to put on GitHub.
  - This repository contains the C# .NETCore Web API which is hosted at <https://api.shineproject.io/swagger>
  - This isn't a project intended to make any money, its just to provide a free service and be a good place to try out new technology.

## Sister repository
 1. You can access the front end website repository at <https://github.com/tommcclean/ShineProject-Web>
 2. You can access the front end consumer facing website at <https://www.shineproject.io>

## How to contribute
 1. This repository and its sister are open for contributions.
 2. You can contribute by documenting issues or feature requests, or by forking the repository and pushing pull requests.
 3. Your pull requests might be improvements to my architecture or code, performance optimisations or new features.
 4. I might look at creating a native mobile app in future, so if you are an aspiring app developer, maybe you want to create a native app client of this API?

## Risks / Notes
 1. The API is not currently versioned
 2. There are a few things I need to do soon which might hinder you a little, such as providing abilities on local development environments including Azure storage emulation and email emulation.
 3. This repository is configured to continously deploy from 'master' at the moment and is hosted on Azure App Services
